                <p>David Bohm was always a dreamer and a scientist at heart.</p>
                <p>Going against his father's original wishes of taking over the family business, <br>
                Bohm heavily pursued mathematics and physics in highschool, and was addmitted to Penn State in 1935.</p>

                    <p>After graduating in 1939 with a bachelor's degree in Physics, Bohm was invited to pursue his master's at Cal Tech</p>
                    <p>However, it wasn't long before his work and impressive intellect caught the eye of another physicist, <br>
                    and in the Spring of 1941, Robert Oppenheimer—the father of the atomic bomb—invited Bohm to complete his PhD at UC Berkely.</p>
                    <p>As a member of Oppenheimer's team, Bohm studied collisions between protons and deuterons that would prove extremely valuable to the United States' building of the atomic bomb.</p>
                    <p>When Oppenheimer was chosen to lead the project at Los Alamos, he wished to take Bohm with him.</p>
                    <p>However, Bohm had previously joined a communist party for a mere 9 months, but that was enough for the U.S. to ban Bohm from joining Oppenheimer in fear that Bohm was a communist spy.</p>
                    <p>The government quickly classified his work and, unable to continue his thesis, he quickly was granted his PhD in theoretical physics in 1943.</p>

                    <p>In 1947, Bohm became an assistant professor of theoretical physics at Princeton University, working closley with amazing physicists such as Albert Eintstein.</p>
                    <p>During his time at Princeton he performed groundbreaking research on multiple quantum mechanical concepts, especially including work on plasma in metals.</p>
                    <p>However, things took a turn for the worst in 1950 when he was arrested for his past communist ties, <br>
                    and that same year he was forced to flee the country after he refused to testify against his colleagues.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>Bohm moved to São Paulo, Brazil in 1951. With Einstein's help, Bohm gained a position as the Professor of Physics at the São Paulo University.</p>
                    <p>Later that year Bohm published one of his most influential books to this day, Quantum Theory.</p>
                    <p>A year later in 1952, he published his paper <cite>A Suggested Interpretation of the Quantum Theory in Terms of "Hidden" Variables</cite>,<br>
                    which went against the orthodox nature of quantum mechanics and general relativity.</p>
                    <p>Angry at these 'radical' theories Bohm expressed and unable to disprove him, Oppenheimer ordered all physicists to simply turn a blind eye to Bohm's Hidden Variables theory stating,</p>
                    <q>If we cannot disprove Bohm, then we must ignore him.</q>
                    <p>And they followed suit, with Einstein calling his work,</p>
                    <q>A physical fairy tale for children.</q>
                    <p>and Neils Bohr simply saying,</p>
                    <q>Very foolish.</q>
