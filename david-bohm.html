                        <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The government quickly classified his work and, unable to continue his thesis, he quickly was granted his PhD in theoretical physics in 1943.</p>

                    <p>That same year, Bohm's wife starts to read a book by Jiddu Krishnamurti, a famous Indian philosopher. Bohm was extremely moved by his writing, and especially interested in his ideas of the observor and the observant.</p>
                    <p>Bohm saw the parallels between the observor and observant and undivided wholeness in quantum mechanics. It seemed that this sparked Bohm's original goal of finding a new order of physics that essentially combined general relativity and quantum theory. In 1960, Bohm started to develop his concepts of implicate and explicate orders, which describes two different frameworks for understanding the same phenomenon or aspect of reality.</p>

                    <p>A few years later in 1980, Bohm published <cite>Wholeness and the Implicate Order</cite> which veered from the technical mechanics of his theories to a broader, philosophical sense of his work.</p>
                    <p>This book and its ideas particularly captured the interest of the public, with the <cite>Sunday Times</cite>writing,</p>
                    <q>[It] has deeply important philosophical implications [...] It provides a worldview that gives a coherent understanding of physical phenomena...</q>

                    <p>Bohm met another physicist at Birkbeck named Francis David Peat, and together they published <cite>Science, Order, and Creativity: A Dramatic New Look at the Creative Roots of Science and Life</cite>.</p>

                    <p>With both <cite>Wholeness and the Implicate Order</cite> and <cite>Science, Order, and Creativity</cite>, it was quite obvious that Bohm was starting to lean towards a philosophical approach to his work.</p>
                    <p>However, his philosophical interests only deepend as he grew closer to Krishnamurti. They regularly discussed ideas of wholeness, human thought, love, conciousness, and the universe, amongst many other ideas.</p>
                    <p>Together, they published one of their most famous collaborative projects, <cite>The Ending of Time</cite> in 1985. Their ideas and conversations were detailed in a myriad of books and publications over the following two decades inclding, <cite>On Dialoge</cite>, <cite>The Wholeness of Life</cite>, <cite>The Limits of Thought</cite>, and <cite>The Future of Humanity</cite>.</p>

                    <p>Bohm speculated dropping theoretical physics altogether, but physicist Basil Hiley, who was a long time colleage of Bohm, convinced him to continue pursuing new, trailblazing ideas within physics.</p>
                    <p>Hiley once again helped rekindle Bohm's interest in pursuing new theories, and on October 27th, 1992, Bohm called his wife excitedly saying he had a great day and felt he was "on to something big".</p>
                    <p>However, Bohm had a heart attack on his way home, and unfortunately never got to tell his wife what had excited him that day.</p>
                    <p>Hiley published their book, <cite>The Undivided Universe: An Ontological Interpretation of Quantum Theory</cite> in 1995.</p>

                    <p>During an interview, Bohm stated that he originally went into the sciences hoping to fix humanity's problems. However, he realized that science itself had many problems, and knew that science may not be the answer. Perhaps this is what drew him so much to philosophy and theories of the human conciousness.</p>
                    <p>He expressed that he always had a theory of an underlying variable within physics that both effected everything and was part of everything, something that was possibly the essence of the universe itself. That may have been why he was so dedicated to his Hidden Variables theory. Regardless, the theory has shifted the focus of quantum theory and mechanics, and it is still being pursued by physicists today.</p>
                    <p>Bohm was an amazing and awe-inspiring physicist. However, he was more than just a physicist, and every publication he has put forth has shown his radical way of thinking.</p>
                    <p>He was ahead of his time, and continues to inspire scientists and philosophers alike to this day. As he so eloquently put it, </p>
                    <q>The ability to perceive or think differently is more important than the knowledge gained.</q>
